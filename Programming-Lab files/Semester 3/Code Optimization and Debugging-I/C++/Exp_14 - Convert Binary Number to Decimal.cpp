// C++ Program to Convert Binary Number to Decimal and vice-versa.

/* 1. The user is asked to enter a binary number and it is stored in the variable ‘num’.
   2. The variable ‘b’ is initialized as 1 and ‘dec’ as 0. num is copied to the variable ‘temp’.
   3. Using a while loop, modulus of temp is stored in ‘rem’.
   4. rem is multiplied with b and added to dec.
   5. In every iteration, b is multiplied with 2.
   6. The loop continues till temp is less than 0.
   7. The decimal equivalent is stored in dec and printed.
