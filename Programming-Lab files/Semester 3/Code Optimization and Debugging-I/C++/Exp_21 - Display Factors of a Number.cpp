//  C++ Program to Display Factors of a Number

// for loop is executed with an initial condition i = 1 and checked whether n is perfectly divisible by i or not. If n is perfectly divisible by i then, i will be the factor of n.


#include <iostream>
using std::cout;

int main() {
    int n = 60, i;

    cout << "Factors of " << n << " are: ";  
    
    for (i = 1; i <= n; ++i) { if (n % i == 0) { cout << i << " ";} }

    return 0;
}

/* Output: Factors of 60 are: 1 2 3 4 5 6 10 12 15 20 30 60
