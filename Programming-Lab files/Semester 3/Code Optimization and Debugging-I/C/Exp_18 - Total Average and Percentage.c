// C program to calculate total average and percentage of five subjects

/* 1.Input marks of five subjects. Store it in some variables say eng, phy, chem, math and comp.
   2.Calculate sum of all subjects and store in total = eng + phy + chem + math + comp.
   3.Divide sum of all subjects by total number of subject to find average i.e. average = total / 5.
   4.Calculate percentage using percentage = (total / 500) * 100.
   5.Finally, print resultant values total, average and percentage.
